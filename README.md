# -Fruits-Dataset---Decision-Tree-Classification-algorithm
A simple machine-learning notebook that uses a Decision Tree Classifier to classify different types of fruits based on their features.

## 🍎🍊 What This Notebook Does

* Loads a fruits dataset
* Performs basic data exploration
* Trains a Decision Tree Classifier
* Visualizes the decision tree (if implemented)
* Evaluates model accuracy

---

## 📁 Files

* `Dicision_Tree_fruits.ipynb` — main notebook
* Fruit dataset (CSV) — required

---

## 🔧 Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
jupyter notebook Dicision_Tree_fruits.ipynb
```

Make sure your CSV dataset is in the same directory or update the path inside the notebook.
